# RepoStock
RepoStock

Our project will serve as a stocking application with a barcode scanner, out-of-stock alerts and notifications, real-time database, stock charts, sales statistics, and product tips. Besides, consumers will be able to make purchases using their contactless payment methods through this application. We anticipate that we will use Kotlin and Google services. This app will be suitable for small or large businesses and will not need another device due to online stocking and sales.
